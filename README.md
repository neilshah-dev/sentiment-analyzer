# Sentiment Analyzer 🧠

This project uses a simple piece of AI to tell whether a sentence sounds **positive**, **negative**, or **neutral**.

It reads any message (like a tweet, review, or email), then gives a score from -1 to +1:
- `+1` means **very positive**
- `0` means **neutral**
- `-1` means **very negative**

## Example
Input:
> I love learning new things!

Output:
> Sentiment polarity: 0.5
